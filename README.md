Details of the Project Repository:
- TextToImageSynthesizerDCGANFinal1.0.ipynb is the final notebook and the one that needs to be run and evaluated.
- The Notebook contains all the instructions to run the notebook.
- checkpoints: This folder consists of the final generator and discriminator model after 100 Epochs of training and can be used as a pretrained model.
- results: This folder consists of images generated by dcgan on training, validation and test split.
-  epoch_loss.csv: This consists of the generator and discriminator losses for the number of training epochs.
